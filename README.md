Earth Invader
=====

Years ago, a terrible invasion by unknown entities was staved off by a lone Earth ship. Now, in the year 2048, humankind has discovered the planets of the coalition that nearly wiped them out, and has elected to send their most skilled pilot to destroy them: you.

Choose your Enemy
======

Decide what type of planet you will battle: a planet whose technology is dominated by Fire, Water, Rock, or Air. Each type will have its own strengths and weaknesses, allowing you to choose which element would be most suitable to defeat it.

Mechanics
=====

Start menu may have little animations if possible, but mainly a play button. After that, it goes to the planet and weapon selection menu. Hitting start will take the player into the game canvas. The player's weapon will have boosts based on what element they picked, and it will do more or less damage depending on the planet-type they select. The player must destroy the planet as fast as possible, and defeat as many defending planet ships as they can. The score will be derived from the number of ships destroyed divided by the time it took to destroy the planet, as well as bonuses for using a harder element. All entities will be a simple shape, planet and the player will be circles, and planet ships as boxes. No pictures allowed, everything must be coded. The planet's color will change depending on the element, as will it's defending ships. The player will have a separate color, and its shots will change color depending on the element.
