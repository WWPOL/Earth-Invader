Earth Invader
=====

A twist on the classic defense mechanic. Years ago, a terrible invasion by unknown entities was staved off by a lone Earth Ship. Now, in the year 2048, a new force has set its sights on Earth. You.

Choose your Enemy
======

Decide what type of Earth you will battle. An Earth whose technology is dominated by Fire, Water, Earth, or Air. Each type will have it's own strenghts and weaknesses, allowing you to choose which element would be most suitable to defeat it.

Mechanics
=====

Start menu may have little animations if possible, but mainly a play button. After that, it goes to the planet and weapon selection menu. Hitting start will take the player into the game canvas. The player's weapon will have boosts based on what element they picked, and it will do more or less damage depending on the Earth-type they select. The player must destroy the Earth as fast as possible, and defeat as many defending Earth ships as they can. The score will be derived from the number of ships destroyed divided by the time it took to destroy Earth, as well as bonuses for using a harder element. All entities will be a simple shape, earth and the player circles, and earth ships as boxes(?). No pictures allowed, everything must be coded. So the Earth will be a blue circle, with different colored streaks depending on the element. It's ships will be the color of the element. The player will have a separate color, and its shots will change color depending on the element.
