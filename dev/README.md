Todo
=====
- [ ] Port game to phaser for 2099 edition
- [ ] Have expanded playing space, have it be same no matter what size screen (extend beyond bounds of screen)
- [ ] ~~Multiplayer support (pvp? coop would make most sense)~~ <-- Too much to sync for something like socket to handle
- [ ] Upgrades, new enemy types, more varied enemy types, new powerups and weapons, different ships with different stats
- [ ] New gameplay (in atmosphere raids after taking down shields?)
- [ ] Have a server (heroku?) to show leaderboard stats
- [ ] Include gravity, use actual equation and have it affect all ships with each other and the planet
